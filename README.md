In this project I will attempt to deconstruct and reconstruct a website.
I will be figuring out how to:
* Move a div around a page in more than one way
* Stick a div onto the top or bottom of a page
* Identify the background color of a webpage
* Center an element horizontally
* Identify three ways to include my CSS styles to a page
* Understand how to use classes and ID's to target CSS at specific elements on a page
* Build a very basic form
